Users of image and video generation apps consistently complain about poor output quality, confusing UX, lack of control, and heavy time/cost overheads.

Image generation pain points

•	Low reliability vs prompt: Users report that results often ignore key details (poses, text, layout, style), forcing many retries even with carefully written prompts.
•	Prompting feels too hard: Many feel they “must be bad at prompting” because small wording changes radically alter results, with little guidance from the tools themselves.
•	Inconsistent quality across tools: People compare the same prompt across apps and see big differences, leading to frustration with platforms that underperform free or cheaper alternatives.
•	Poor integration / clunky flows: Users dislike having to jump between “chat” and “image” modes, or hidden/indirect image actions instead of a clear “generate/edit” workflow.
•	Limited control & editing: Lack of fine control (pose, composition, small corrections) and weak in painting/out painting makes it hard to fix “almost right” images without starting over.
•	Model choice confusion: Where multiple models exist, people find it unclear which to pick, what each is good at, or why one suddenly performs worse than another.
•	Cost vs value: Users question paying subscriptions when they can get similar or better results with other free/cheap services or local models, especially if they only need images occasionally.

Video generation pain points

•	From vague idea to script: Creators say tools do not help convert rough ideas and notes into solid video concepts, hooks, or structures; ideation still feels manual.
•	Narrative continuity: Generated clips often lack coherent story flow, forcing heavy manual editing to stitch scenes into something watchable.
•	Avatar/facial consistency: Faces, lighting, and expressions shift between frames or scenes, breaking immersion and requiring frame by frame fixes.
•	Mismatch of audio, voice, and visuals: Users struggle to get voice overs, on screen actions, and visual timing to align; many runs are thrown away.
•	Time consuming iteration: Rendering multiple versions to get one usable clip is slow and expensive, especially for longer content.

UX and workflow issues

•	Hidden features / confusing UI: People call out “puzzling” integration where image/video options are buried or tied to odd triggers instead of a simple, direct interface.
•	Lack of guided workflows: Most tools just expose a prompt box instead of structured flows (storyboard → shot list → scenes), leaving users to design the entire process themselves.
•	Project management friction: Organizing generations, versions, and assets across projects is often weak; users resort to manual file management and screenshots.

Trust, spam, and platform-level pain

•	Feeds flooded with low value AI content: Facebook users complain their feeds are “swamped” with unrealistic AI photos (e.g., perfect cabins, kids’ rooms) that feel like spam.
•	Difficulty recognizing fakes: Many regular users do not realize content is synthetic; others feel manipulated when they discover “all contents are AI GENERATED, so fake.”
•	Group/admin friction: Some Facebook group admins decline AI generated posts because they are “not real,” causing tension between creators and moderators.
•	Association with scams: Research shows spam/scam pages using large volumes of AI images for engagement, which hurts user trust in both content and the underlying tools.
Opportunities for better products
•	Idea-to-asset workflows: Help users go from messy notes to structured prompts, scripts, and storyboards instead of just providing a raw prompt field.
•	Control and iteration tools: Stronger editing, visual controls, and “refine this specific part” features to reduce full re renders.
•	Transparent quality & pricing: Clear expectations of what each model/plan can do, plus visible cost per run, to reduce regret about paid tiers.
•	Trust and labeling: Better disclosure and controls for distributing AI content on social platforms to address spam, deception, and user fatigue.
